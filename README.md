Version Numbers 

Major is a major update to the software
Minor is a small update to the software
Revision is any change made (bug fixes, small updates)
Build number (normally an auto increment if used)
In your example (1.7.1.0):

Major version 1
Had 7 minor updates
First revision/bugfix
No build number
1.7.1.0 would this be the first maintenance release to the 1.7 version of the product.

Even defining what the difference between a major and minor release is, is difficult. Major releases normally include significant new features. Minor releases may include fixes and new features, but usually nothing ground breaking.

Build numbers increment with every release, no matter how minor the changes might be. It is automatically incremented by the build process, every time it runs. Many builds are never see publicly released, but they can help in managing the life cycle of the software, by making it easy for QA to uniquely identify a version of the software.
